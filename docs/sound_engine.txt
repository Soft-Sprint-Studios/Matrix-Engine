// - Pathos sound engine -
//===========================

Pathos uses an OpenAL implementation for playing sound, with OGG used
for music playback. Currently the engine supports OGG only for music
playback, and 16 and 8-bit WAV for game sounds.

Head-related transfer functions and EAX reverb effects are used for
enhanced sound effects.

Thanks to the OpenAL-Soft development team for their software OpenAL
implementation.
