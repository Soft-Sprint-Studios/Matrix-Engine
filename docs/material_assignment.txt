// - Assigning material types -
//===============================

Pathos allows you to more comfortably assign material types for each
of the textures in your level. Instead of manually editing your material
files, you can use console commands to help make it easier.

You have the ability to list all the textures in your level that use the
"default" material. This is usually concrete, which all newly generated
material files are set to.

Here at the commands listed below:
 - r_list_default_materials. - This will generate a list of all materials
 in your map that are not assigned a non-default material type. You can
 then use this list to select a texture to display on-screen.
 
 - r_show_list_material - Use this with the index of the texture you want
 to display. The engine will then diplay this material on-screen, so you
 know what texture you are working with. Calling it with -1 will cause the
 texture to stop being diplayed on-screen.
 
 - r_set_texture_material - Call this with the material type name you want
 to assign to this texture. These material types are the ones referenced in
 the footstep and materialdefs files in your scripts folder. The command will
 then change the material type in the PMF file, and write it to disk, and the
 texture will stop being displayed on-screen.
 
 - An example of using it:
r_list_default_materials
r_show_list_material 0
r_set_texture_material 0 computer
...
r_show_list_material 74
r_set_texture_material 74 concrete
